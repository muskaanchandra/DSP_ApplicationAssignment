The different IMFs are visualised in EMD_Visualisation.ipynb


The decomposed wavelets using DWT and the reconstructed signal can be seen in DWT_Visualisation.ipynb



OnlyNN.ipynb predicts stock prices using a simple sequential NN model


EMD2NN.ipynb is used to implement the EMD2NN and EMD2LSTM models


DWT2NN.ipynb is used to implement the DWT2NN and DWT2LSTM models



The data used is closing prices from the NASDAQ index

While writing our codes, we took help from the following sources:
https://github.com/MProx/Wavelet-denoising/blob/master/wavelets.py
and 
https://github.com/zhoudafa08/EMD2FNN/blob/master/EMD2FNN.py


We have added a new file called FigureCitations to include the ones that we missed earlier
